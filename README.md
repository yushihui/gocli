# Preamble
## Two worlds
Today most of network engineers still rely on the CLI to config/manage/trouble-shooting their devices, they are living in CLI world, what we provide is a GUI both 7.0+ and 6.0-, this is an good solution, but not a straightforward one. sometimes itâ€™s a little bit complicated for them to use. So we provide GUI world; 2 different worlds. This might be one reason they spend few time on our product.
